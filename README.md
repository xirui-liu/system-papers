## Machine learning system papers:

[Managed Communication and Consistency for Fast Data-Parallel Iterative Analytics](http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/BigLearning/CMU-PDL-15-105.pdf)

**Goal**: With Adaptive revision, algorithm throughput of SGD can be significantly improved by Bosenâ€™s managed communication without manual parameter tuning


## Distributed system papers

### Consensus Algorithm
[In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)

**Goal**: Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.  It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and
it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems
